\section{Useful resources}
In this section I will try to list some useful resources (mainly websites) to look for information concerning python.
\begin{itemize}
\item The official documentation: \url{https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/index.html}
\item \url{http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics}
\item A website quite beginner friendly: \url{https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php}
\end{itemize}

\section{Good coding practive}
\begin{itemize}
\item When opening or saving a file, it is good to specify the encoding.
\item When accessing the value of a key which may not exist of a dictionary, the \texttt{get} method is the right way:
\begin{verbatim}
entities = message.get("entities", [])
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\begin{loggentry}{05.10.17}{Starting with python, anaconda and jupyter notebook}
Since a couple of days I try to assimilate the bases of Python.\\
I did a little latex file called ``Python doc and how to start" where I explain in detail how to start with python.\\
At first I was a bit puzzled by the fact that Python needs an interpreter and not a compiler (the difference is quite well explained in the book of Charles Severance p.8). I'm still a bit confused by the notions of Python virtual environment and in which way it differs from a virtual machine. I found a nice explanation there:\\
\url{https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/containers-are-not-vms/}\\
but it seems to be a reading a bit too advanced for my current knowledge. I started by installing Anaconda and it seems to be one of the easiest way to begin using Python.\\
I was a bit confused at the beginning before I had the following understanding of programming. First we write a script in a text file (generally inside a IDE) and then use a compiler (by pressing on a button in the IDE for instance) which translates it into some machine language and gives it to the CPU. And because of this I was failing to see how it could be done in several ways and what could be a virtual environment. Now I see it a bit differently. I see Python as a bunch of files (which include all the packages that we add little by little) describing a function which is called when we use \texttt{python arguments} in the terminal. So having a virtual environment is just telling to the computer ``now when I say \texttt{python} in the terminal, I want you to use these files there".\\
It seems there is no standard editor for python script. I've been recommended to use jupyter notebook, pycharm and sublime. At first jupyter notebook didn't behave how I wanted. When I was in a virtual environment with python 2 installed and launched jupyter notebook from the command line, I was only able to create python 3 kernel. The problem was that I had not installed the package jupyter notebook in this virtual environment so it was going back to the root (the python installed ``normally" on my linux) to find it. But then I installed the package jupyter notebook in all my virtual environment and it solved the problem.\\
I learned a bit about \textbf{list}, \textbf{tuples} and \textbf{dictionaries} (globally data structures) here:\\
\url{https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries}\\
and abount sequence type here:\\
\url{https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#sequence-types-list-tuple-range}\\
and a bit about \textbf{class} and \textbf{methods} here:\\
\url{http://networkstatic.net/python-tutorial-classes-objects-methods-init-and-simple-examples/}\\
I also discovered the keyword \texttt{pass} which is explained here:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13886168/how-to-use-the-pass-statement-in-python}\\
I also had difficulty to change the language of the dictionary of texmaker but I found the solution here (although it is supposed to be for windows):\\
\url{http://www.swisswuff.ch/wordpress/?p=166}\\
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{06.10.17}{yield, iterables, generators, with}
I learned a bit about the keyword \texttt{yield}, \textbf{iterables} and \textbf{generators} here:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do}\\
As I'm trying to create a python script to download songs from internet and that \texttt{youtube\_dl} seems to be the right command to this in python, I tried to read this page:\\
\url{https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#embedding-youtube-dl}\\
But for this I needed to understand what the keyword \texttt{with} was. I found several links:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1369526/what-is-the-python-keyword-with-used-for#11783672}\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3012488/what-is-the-python-with-statement-designed-for}\\
\url{effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm}\\
\url{https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/typecontextmanager.html}
\url{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/}\\
But these pages require already a good basic knowledge of python so I didn't get everything.\\
\textbf{Edit2 (20.02.18):} I read again \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1369526/what-is-the-python-keyword-with-used-for#11783672}{this page} about the \texttt{with} statement. It is a kind of safety command. If we open a file, and then do some manipulation with it, we want the file (or maybe the flow) to be closed if an error occurs. This command \texttt{with} guarantees it.\\
\textbf{Edit:} I found this page concerning \textbf{generators} which is quite beginner-friendly:\\
\url{https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators}
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{08.10.17}{Adding a password to jupyter notebook}
I would like to get rid of this page appearing each time I start a jupyter notebook where I have to insert the password. I found this page which might tell me how to do it:\\
\url{https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html}\\
but as I didn't find this jupyter folder, I wanted to use the command \texttt{find} but and as I would like to filter out all the ``permission denied" errors, I read this page:\\
\url{https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42841/how-to-skip-permission-denied-errors-when-running-find-in-linux#42842}\\
I wasn't sure what was the symbol $|$ for but I found it p.14 of the bashguide pdf given by TheAlternative.\\
I also found out what a symbolic link is there:\\
\url{https://kb.iu.edu/d/abbe}\\
As I didn't find the config file I created one as indicated and I received this message from the console indicating where the configuration file for jupyter was put:
\begin{verbatim}
Writing default config to: /home/aritz/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
\end{verbatim}
Even though I created this passord when I was inside the virtual environment my\_python35 it seems that now when I enter the command \texttt{jupyter notebook} in this environment or on the normal one I'm directed to a page where I need to enter the password I chose (and no longer copy paste the code appearing in the terminal or clicking on the link appearing in the terminal).\\
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{11.10.17}{youtube dl for python (Roman)}
Roman sent me a link to a one of his projects on GitHub where he used python and youtube\_dl:\\
\url{http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rlyapin/video_summarization/blob/master/video_summarization_with_dl_embeddings_%28part_II%29.ipynb}.
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{12.10.17}{Vectorized operations in Python: lists, Creating and manipulating matrices with NumPy, Comprehension lists, asterisk (how to transform a list into positional arguments for a function), zip, and other tools}
I started looking at the exercises of the course CIL. Everything which follows comes more or less from the first exercise sheet of CIL. I learned a few command to use NumPy objects and methods with the exercise sheet 1.
The library NumPy seems to provide the basic tool to do array manipulation and vectorized operations which are computationally lighter for python that using for loops. If I understood well what is written here:\\
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11077023/what-are-the-differences-between-pandas-and-numpyscipy-in-python#11077215}{stack overflow: difference pandas and numpy}\\
NumPy provides the basis and pandas some more advanced tools.\\
Comprehension lists seems the tool to do a lot of vectorized operations, or to apply a function iteratively to entry of one or more lists. It is presented here:\\
\href{https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions}{list comprehensions}\\
I learned about the \texttt{zip} function. Somehow, it inverses the dimensions in a list.\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13704860/zip-lists-in-python#13704903}\\
The exercise 1 instruction sheet contains a list of basic vectorized operations and the associated commands in python.\\
I learned useful informations about the use of asterisk in order to take a list as input, and expand it into actual positional arguments in the function call, or deal with extra argument in a function, here:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5239856/foggy-on-asterisk-in-python}\\
and there:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/400739/what-does-asterisk-mean-in-python}\\
The last exercise was nice. It consisted in computing for some points in $\R^2$ their likelihood depending on two different Gaussian model assumption and assigning each point to the most likely model.
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{14.10.17}{More arrays with NumPy}
I found this nice tutorial to use NumPy:\\
\href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html}{NumPy Tutorial}\\
and learned how to manipulate these arrays. 
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{15.10.17}{Beginning of first ML project}
I think I should decide a naming convention for my files and directories. I think I will always try to put Capital letters at the beginning of the name of a folder and lower case for files.\\
There is a nice explanation of what this SSH encryption is here:\\
\href{https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-the-ssh-encryption-and-connection-process}{Understandin the SSH encryption and connection process}\\
I also started the first project of the course Machine Learning of ETH.\\
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{16.10.17}{ML project, trying to get started:  Sumatra, Scikitlearn}
I kept trying to do this ML project but there are plenty of things to get familiar with before being able to start like Sumatra and Scikitlearn (c.f. journal project ML1 for more details). I came across this page which gives a very good introduction to machine learning and how to use python for it:\\
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html}{basic tutorial on scikit learn}\\
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{17.10.17}{Python coding guideline, Python modules and packages, python classes and metaclasses, doctstrings, API, signatures, magic methods}
I found this general guideline for python coding style:\\
\url{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}\\
I learned a few things concerning python packages and modules in these two webpages:\\
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9048518/importing-packages-in-python#9049246}{importing subpackages}\\
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7948494/whats-the-difference-between-a-python-module-and-a-python-package#7948672}{difference module and packages}\\
For more informations about modules and packages this page looks very detailed:\\
\url{https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html}\\
Concerning the Scikit-learn part of the project we are encouraged to read the following webpages:\\
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#coding-guidelines}{coding guidlines}\\
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#apis-of-scikit-learn-objects}{APIs of scikit-learn objects}\\
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html#rolling-your-own-estimator}{rolling your own estimator}\\
I think I start seeing why we use this scikit-learn. This story of fit, fit transform etc... is described in the ``API's of scikit-learn objects" section. If I get it right, the organizers of the project want us all to use the same kind of syntax with the function/method/API that we use in our code.\\
I found another good website for python documentation:
\url{http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics}\\
And in particular for docstrings:\\
\href{http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-docstrings/}{docstrings}\\
I will put all good tutorials for python in the latex file ``how to use python".\\
This two webpages explain in a complementary way what a python signature is (more or less):\\
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2322736/what-is-the-difference-between-function-declaration-and-signature#2323005}{difference between function declaration and signature}\\
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2677185/how-can-i-read-a-functions-signature-including-default-argument-values#2677263}{how to read the signature of a function}\\
There's a beginning of information concerning API's here:\\
\url{https://wiki.python.org/moin/API}\\
I found an interesting page about classes and magic methods here:\\
\href{https://www.python-course.eu/python3_magic_methods.php}{magic methods and operator overloading}\\
I also found this great webpage about objects, classes, and metaclasses in python:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python#6581949}
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{18.10.17}{More on scikit-learn}
The organizers published a very helpful sequence of slide which I called 
\begin{verbatim}
final_submission_instructions
\end{verbatim}
which explains a bit better how to use this scikit-learn framework.
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{19.10.17}{Trying to follow the instructions provided for the ML project, git, pipeline}
Otherwise I finished following the instructions given by in the file called ``final submission instructions". I really didn't do much as everything was implemented but I got a bit an idea of what these different tools are. There are still plenty of things I need to figure out (see my ml project journal for more details).\\
Concerning scikit-learn pipeline, I found these two pages which seem very good:\\
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33091376/python-what-is-exactly-sklearn-pipeline-pipeline#33094099}{Stack Overflow: sklearn pipeline}\\
and\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/grid_search_text_feature_extraction.html}\\
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{24.10.17}{Flake8, Submitting my code for ML project 1}
I will try to submit my code (even though it is exactly what the tutors gave us as a model). I ran the command \texttt{flake8} and corrected what was pointed out. It seems to indicate style errors (like additional spaces at the end of a line) in order to obtain a code which follows some standards. Here is a webpage which introduces it well:\\
\href{https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/what-is-flake8-and-why-we-should-use-it-b89bd78073f2}{Flake8}
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{26.10.17}{Scikit-Learn tutorial}
I started to read the first scikit-learn tutorial:\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html}
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{28.10.17}{Saving objects with Pickle, getting familiar with scikit-learn, and merging numpy arrays}
I learned a few things about the \texttt{pickle} tool in these tow pages:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8968884/python-serialization-why-pickle#8968969}\\
\url{https://www.thoughtco.com/using-pickle-to-save-objects-2813661}\\
I progressed in the reading of the scikit-learn tutorial. I learned fitting, predicting, splitting the data set into a train set and a test set, saving python object with \texttt{pickle}, reshaping a data set, the K-nearest neighbor algorithm, from these pages:\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html}\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/settings.html}\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/supervised_learning.html}\\
I also learned how to merge/concatenate numpy arrays with the commands \texttt{np.r} and \texttt{np.c} here mainly:\\
\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.r_.html}\\
and here\\
\url{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.c_.html}\\
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{30.10.17}{Plots for support machine algorithm with Python}
In the scikit-learn documentation there is this nice script to output plot to delimit the boundaries of the areas computed by the support machine algorithm:\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_iris.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-svm-plot-iris-py}\\
I read an interesting page about randomness in python here:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7029993/differences-between-numpy-random-and-random-random-in-python}
It looks like numpy.random is the most convenient library.
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{31.10.17}{Sequence type objects, mutable and immutable types, built in functions, lists, cross-validation}
\url{https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_pop.htm}
I learned plenty of interesting things about lists and more generally sequence type objects here:\\
\href{https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#sequence-types-list-tuple-range}{Official documentation on list tuple and range}\\
Among which the way memory is shared when doing copy of an object (which Roman told me about). This is also related to:\\
\href{https://docs.python.org/3.6/faq/programming.html#faq-multidimensional-list}{How to create a multidimensional list}\\
Concerning the topic of memory allocation, I think this topic is actually the ``mutable and immutable types" topic in python. I read something very interesting about it here:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8056130/immutable-vs-mutable-types}\\
it reminds me of pointers in C++. I have the impression that immutable types variable behave like ``normal" variable while mutable looks like pointers. \\
Here is a list of built-in functions, i.e. functions that we can use in a python script without having to use \texttt{import}:\\
\url{https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html}\\
There is also a very nice list of questions and answers for python programming here:\\
\href{https://docs.python.org/3.6/faq/programming.html#faq-multidimensional-list}{Programming FAQ}\\
I learned a few things on for loops and iterable here:\\
\url{https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop}\\
I learned what the
\begin{verbatim}
%s
\end{verbatim}
symbol means here:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/997797/what-does-s-mean-in-python#997807}\\
I learned how to do cross-validation in python here:\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/model_selection.html}
It presents several ways to do cross-validation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The naive implementation, where we cut manually the data set and use a normal for loop.
\item An implementation using ``Cross validation generators" like \texttt{KFold} which produce distinct set of indices to separate between training and testing set, and using a regular for loop.
\item An implementation using ``Cross validation generators" like \texttt{KFold} which produce distinct set of indices to separate between training and testing set, and using a comprehension list instead of a regular for loop.
\item A method using the \texttt{cross\_val\_score} helper, which is a kind of wrapper for the previous method.
\end{enumerate}
Now all these methods, tell us how to compute the average score across the k different folds for one value of the parameter of our estimation model that we want to choose. To choose it well one might use a for loop over a grid of values for this parameter using one of the method above. Or one can use a wrapper called \texttt{GridSearchCV} like displayed below (example taken from the tutorial):
\begin{verbatim}
lasso = Lasso(random_state=0)
alphas = np.logspace(-4, -0.5, 30)

tuned_parameters = [{'alpha': alphas}]
n_folds = 3

clf = GridSearchCV(lasso, tuned_parameters, cv=n_folds, refit=False)
clf.fit(X, y)
scores = clf.cv_results_['mean_test_score']
scores_std = clf.cv_results_['std_test_score']
\end{verbatim}
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{01.11.17}{cross-validation and grid searching for parameters of ML algorithm, ploting with python}
I kept reading the tutorial presented above concerning cross validation. It presented a tool called \texttt{GridSearchCV} designed to for an optimal parameter among a set of parameters for a regression/classification algo using cross validation.\\
Also, if I understood right, stratified cross validation is used if we have a classifier, and then the observations are distributed in the different folds in a way assuring that there are (more or less) the same number of observations with a given label in each class.\\
I learned what the \texttt{enumerate} command does here:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22171558/what-does-enumerate-mean}\\
I found this nice tutorial for ploting with python:\\
\url{http://matplotlib.org/users/pyplot_tutorial.html}\\
There is a more detailed page in the scikit-learn tutorial dedicated to cross-validation but I didn't read it yet:\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation}\\
To create a list of values between two values with a given increment the tool is numpy \texttt{arange}\\
I tried to do the exercise at the end of this page:\\
\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/model_selection.html}\\
but I obtain different results with different methods and it is not coherent with the solution. I need to investigate furthermore. Actually the main difference between what I had done and the solution was that I was shuffling the observations in the data and not the solution. The solution is also restricting itself to only the first 150 observations (I don't know why), which also had an influence. The file which contains my solution was called ``scikit-learn ex4" with an underscore.\\
For the normalization of data, I also found this scikit-learn page:\\
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html#preprocessing-normalization}{sk-learn: normalization}\\
It is part of a bigger tutorial on how to preprocess the data. The tool for normalization seems to be \texttt{StandardScaler} which is presented here:\\
\href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html}{sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler}
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{04.11.17}{PCA with python, Exceptions and error handling}
I looked a bit at this PCA, and here is what I learned. If we have some centered data $X\in \R^{n\times p}$ (meaning the average value of each column of $X$ is $0$), the covariance matrix of the $p$ features is estimated by
$$
C=\tfrac{1}{n-1}X^TX.
$$
We aim to somehow reduce the dimensionality of $X$ while keeping the most information, i.e. the most variance. We perform Singular value decomposition (c.f. \href{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134282/relationship-between-svd-and-pca-how-to-use-svd-to-perform-pca#134283}{Stack Exchange: PCA and SVD}, \href{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/125684/how-does-fundamental-theorem-of-factor-analysis-apply-to-pca-or-how-are-pca-l}{Stack Exchange: Loadings and Eigenvectors} for instance) on $X$ and we get
$$
X=USV^T
$$
where 
$
U\in \R^{n \times n},\ V\in\R^{p\times p}
$ 
and $S$ is a diagonal matrix, and 
$$
U^TU = \operatorname{Id}, \qquad V^TV = \operatorname{Id}
$$
which implies that 
$$
C=VLV^T \qquad \text{with} \qquad L = \tfrac{1}{n-1}S^2.
$$
This last decomposition is called Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The columns of $V$ are eigenvectors of $C$, also called \textbf{principal axis} or \textbf{principal directions}. The columns $v_i$ of $XV$ are called \textbf{principal components}.\\
If I understood it right, when we do in python
\begin{verbatim}
pca = PCA(n_components=20).fit(X)
\end{verbatim}
we keep only the first $20$ columns of $V$ (get $\tilde{V}\in \R^{p\times 20}$) and of $U$ (get $\tilde{U}\in \R^{n\times 20}$), and only the first $20$ columns of $L$ (get $\tilde{L}\in \R^{20 \times p}$). So we have a new data matrix 
$
\tilde{X} \in \R^{n\times p}
$ 
which satisfies 
$$
\tilde{X} = \tilde{U}\tilde{L}\tilde{V},
$$
but has only rank $20$. I think that the attribute 
\begin{verbatim}
pca.components_
\end{verbatim}
contains $\tilde{X}\tilde{V}$, but Actually I'm quite confused. I tried to follow an example of wikipedia to see precisely what is what, but it turns out that the pca method of sk-learn doesn't give me the expected result.\\
From what I read online, if the sole purpose that we have is to compute the SVD, then this might be better:\\
\href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.svd.html}{scipy.linalg.svd}

At the end I couln't figure out what this .components\_ attribute was. I wrote a jupyter notebook called PCA\_SVD\_test where I tried to find out but I failed. Ultimately I posted a question on Cross Validated:\\
\href{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/311908/what-is-pca-components-in-sk-learn}{Cross Validated: meaning of pca.components\_}\\
\textbf{Edit:} Someone answered. It seems that PCA assumes centered columns and in my example the columns were not centered...\\\\
\textbf{Edit (05.05.18):} Someone posted a more detailed answer on my stack exchange/cross validated tread, with a project used as illustration.\\
I read something interesting about \textbf{exceptions and errors handling} here:\\
\href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13484740/what-are-exceptions-in-python}{Stack Overflow: exception handling}\\
If I understand well exceptions in python are objects of some predefined classes. What I don't understand is how to trow an error of a specific type. For instance if I want to check that the arguments received by a function are of the appropriate type and throw an error if they aren't how do I do?

Then, I'm supposed to install and unzip a file in a directory of my choice, and update my system's path so that Python can find the package, plus several other complicated things. Since Joffrey seems to be able to solve his problem with matlab, I don't think I will try further to install this because I'm a bit worried I might hurt my computer and screw up the whole system.\\

After reading the message of soumith here:\\

An important remark is that the library is called \texttt{torch} and not \texttt{pytorch} inside python (meaning one has to use \texttt{import torch}).\\

I learned a bit about the \texttt{\_\_iter\_\_()} and \texttt{\_\_next\_\_()}: if I understood it well, these methods are only some ``internal machinery", and are not really supposed to be used by the user.

    best_tag_id = bptrs_t[best_tag_id]
    best_path.append(best_tag_id)
\end{verbatim}
Also in this tutorial, I ran across \texttt{assert} which is used for sanity check, or more precisely to verify that something holds (if it doesn't it produces an error). The code was:

\begin{loggentry}{06.05.18}{Installing spaCy, pip vs pip3,  spaCy vs NLTK}
I started \textbf{installing Spacy}, following this webpage:\\
\url{https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/04/natural-language-processing-made-easy-using-spacy-%e2%80%8bin-python/}\\
After having activated mypy36, I entered
\begin{verbatim}
sudo pip3 install spacy
\end{verbatim}
But it didn't work properly. spacy was installed on the root environment instead of mypy36. I think that it is because I don't pip3 in mypy36, but only pip. That made me wonder what was the \textbf{difference between pip and pip3}. If I understood well \href{https://www.quora.com/What-is-difference-between-pip-and-pip3}{this answer} I think that pip is supposed to be used (at least when working directly on the root) for python 2.7 whereas pip3 is supposed to be used for python 3.5 and onward. I guess that when we activate a virtual environment (like mypy36) using python 3, then we can use pip or pip3 interchangeably (as long as both pip and pip3 are installed in the given virtual environment). Actually it seems that in this last case, it is really the same thing if I believe what is written in this post:\\
\url{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40189744/should-i-use-pip-or-pip3-to-install-python3-packages-inside-of-a-virtual-environ}
and also the output of this command:\\
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}
I uninstall spacy from the root environment with
\begin{verbatim}
sudo pip3 uninstall spacy
\end{verbatim}
and tried spacy in mypy36 with
\begin{verbatim}
sudo pip install spacy
\end{verbatim}
but it seems to have failed:\\

\end{verbatim}
which makes me believe that for some reason it was installed in the python2.7 of the root but I really don't get why. Maybe using \texttt{sudo} implicitly imply installing things on the root. So I tried
\begin{verbatim}
pip install spacy
\end{verbatim}
and it seems to have worked!\\
But then I tried to do the next step of \href{https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/04/natural-language-processing-made-easy-using-spacy-%e2%80%8bin-python/}{the tutorial} but it didn't work:

/home/aritz/anaconda3/envs/mypy36/bin/python: Error while finding module specification for 'spacy.en.download' (ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'spacy.en')

\end{verbatim}
so instead I used
\begin{verbatim}
python -m spacy download en
\end{verbatim}
and it worked. Then I could proceed with this tutorial:\\
\url{https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/04/natural-language-processing-made-easy-using-spacy-%e2%80%8bin-python/}\\

From now on I will use always pip and not pip3 for my virtual environments.\\

I must say I don't really understand what are these ``data and models" from spaCy. So I went on the official page:\\
\url{https://spacy.io/models/}\\
but it didn't help me much. I don't understand exactly what these models are supposed to do. It looks like spaCy can do plenty of things but it is not clear to me how this relates to pytorch and tensorflow. Is it supposed to be combined with these models or can it perform these tasks completely independently?\\
It seems that there are two big libraries designed especially for NLP tasks: NLTK and spaCy. Here are some \textbf{difference between NLTK and spaCy}: From wikipedia: ``Unlike NLTK, which is widely used for teaching and research, spaCy focuses on providing software for production usage." What comes again and again online is that NLTK provides more features, more liberty, and may be good for some specific rare tasks, and that spaCy just implements for each task the best method to perform it, with computationally more efficient way than NLTK. And the default methods of spaCy are supposed to be constantly updated to satisfy state of the art results, so updating spaCy might boost the performance of a script using it. So I guess that spaCy would be better for industry. These two pages provide summaries of the differences:\\
\url{https://blog.thedataincubator.com/2016/04/nltk-vs-spacy-natural-language-processing-in-python/}\\
\url{https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/69xbkc/question_spacy_or_nltk/}\\
From this last article the API's of spaCy are more object oriented which makes it more pythonic. The only real default of spaCy seems to be the fact that it was usable only for English at the time (April 2016) where the article was written. But this may have changed since then. When I go on this page:\\
\url{https://spacy.io/models/}\\
and look at the models it seems that other languages are supported.

I looked at the beginning of this tutorial:\\
\url{https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/04/natural-language-processing-made-easy-using-spacy-%e2%80%8bin-python/}\\
which displays some of the possibilities of spaCy and copied the code in a notebook called spaCy\_tutorial\_trip\_advisor\_review and if I get it right, it is a library which does all these NLP tasks (without any help from TF or Pytorch (at least from the user perspective)). It seems very efficient and would save me a lot of time if I could use it instead of reimplementing it.
\end{loggentry}

\begin{loggentry}{07.05.18}{\texttt{string} library, more on spaCy}
I discovered the \href{https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html}{string library} which seems to contain plenty of useful utilities encapsulated in classes or constants. For instance \texttt{string.punctuation} is a string containing all the \textbf{punctuation symbols concatenated}:\\
\begin{verbatim}
'!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~'
\end{verbatim}
It was used in the \href{https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/04/natural-language-processing-made-easy-using-spacy-%e2%80%8bin-python/}{Analytics Vidhya tutorial about spacy} to \textbf{remove punctation from texts during the tokenization}.

I looked again at \textbf{spaCy}, using in particular this tutorial:\\
\url{https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/04/natural-language-processing-made-easy-using-spacy-%e2%80%8bin-python/}\\
(this page
\url{https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features}
was quite useful to get the details).\\ 
I list here what I understood from it when going through the tutorial:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using this library and its ``models" (for instance \texttt{en} as in \texttt{nlp = spacy.load("en")}) we can create objects from a string (which contains a text). Upon creation of this object, the text is parsed into token and sentences, tokens get various kinds of (predefined) labels/tags, entities are identified and assigned to some (predefined) labels/tags. All these quantities are stored as attributes of the object created (the type is \texttt{spacy.tokens.doc.Doc}) and can then easily be accessed.
\item I have the impression that there are two ways to load a model:
\begin{verbatim}
nlp = spacy.load("en")
\end{verbatim}
and
\begin{verbatim}
from spacy.lang.en import English
parser = English()
\end{verbatim}
\item It performs dependency parsing on the tokens (I'm not very familiar with this yet).
\item If I understand it well, some models have been pretrained and are automatically used in order to create these objects.
\item One can train his own model on his own data set:\\
\url{https://spacy.io/usage/training}\\
\item It offers visualization tools:\\
\url{https://spacy.io/usage/visualizers}\\
\end{itemize}
This tutorial might also be good even if it dates from 2015:\\
\url{http://nicschrading.com/project/Intro-to-NLP-with-spaCy/}\\

\textbf{Edit (30.11.18):} In a script from Vien I ran into the class \textbf{PhraseMatcher} from spacy which allows one to find some patterns in a list of documents (or words) (a bit like regex) and can trigger some actions depending on what is found. This page gives a good idea of the basics:\\

In particular one can modify a variable (or more specifically the value to which a name is referencing) defined outside the function with methods, typically:\\
\begin{verbatim}
my_l.append(4)
\end{verbatim}
but if we use inside the function something like
\begin{verbatim}
my_l = [2, 4]

then we create a new variable/name which will disappear outside of the function.\\
This page:\\

explains why if one uses something like
\begin{verbatim}
a = 0
def f(x):

    return((a, b))
f(10)

There are a couple of interesting points:\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Better to encapsulate the reading of the data into a function or a class.
\item Loading dataframes with pandas or numpy is not memory efficient, so should be avoided for big data frames.
\item Encoding issues and a library to avoid problems.
\item Using \href{https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple}{namedtuple} to create new immutable types to represent the events/row. It looks like using a dictionary to represent a row but the difference is that one cannot change the entries (immutable type) and it is more memory efficient (faster access and three times memory to store it).
\item ``how to serialize CSV data with Avro so that the data is stored not only in a compact format but with its schema as well".

What is important to know is that the names of the test scripts should start by `test\_' (without the slash), that the name of the test function/methods should also start by `test\_', the name of the test classes should start with `Test', as explained here:\\

I also read about software API/CLI adapters here:\\
\url{https://pythontesting.net/strategy/software-api-cli-interface-adapters/}\\
which enable to \textbf{test some python scripts from inside another python} script. This page was useful to understand the \textbf{subprocess module}:\\

Since Python 3.6, one can use \textbf{static type checking}, meaning we can verify that variables and arguments have the correct type. This tutorial introduces it well:\\
