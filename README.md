This repository is a clone of what was stored on my personal computer. It contains journals where I gather useful information concerning computer science, programming, and machine learning, together with some additional documents, scripts, etc... I don't think that it can be useful to someone else than me because its structure reflects the (somehow random) way I learned these things and was not meant to be a tutorial. It is only on github to help me syncronize different computers.
